# The purpose of this project
This is a project which allows to see how the redux library works.  
  
Shows how :
 - the standard DOM can be manipulate using Redux lib.
 - Redux can work with 2 states and 2 reducers
 - to use middleware for intercepting manipulation before actually dispatching the action.

Implemented functionality:

 * Todos 
   * add todo
   * remove todo
   * toggle todo  
  
 * Goals  
   * add goals
   * remove goal
    
 * Middleware
   * implement middleware to achieve the following behavior:  
     * Display an alert ` That's a great goal! ` whenever a new goal is added.
     * Display ` Don't forget to [name of your todo item]! ` whenever a new todo item is added.
